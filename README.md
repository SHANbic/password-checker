# password-checker

For this project, I built something pretty useful didn't I ? A password checker making use of the pwnedpasswords.com API. The program tells you how many times the password you entered was hacked before.

Once you cloned this repo, you just have to execute the program by opening your terminal and typing:
```terminal
python3 pw_checker.py my_password
```

"my_password" stands for the password you want to check. You can check several passwords in one go by typing them all in a row, separated by a space.
